Project Showcase: Productivity Tracker
Project Name: Productivity Tracker & Time Analytics

What it does: A private, browser-based tool that helps users track daily tasks and visualize completion patterns. It analyzes "Peak Productivity" hours to help users optimize their schedules without requiring an account or external tracking.

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3 (Mobile-First Design), JavaScript (Local Storage API), and FontAwesome.

Biggest Challenge: Managing the Serverless Function size limit (250 MB) during deployment and implementing a "NoIndex" privacy strategy to ensure user dashboards remain hidden from public search engines like Google.
